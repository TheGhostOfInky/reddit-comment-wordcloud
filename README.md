# Reddit comment wordcloud maker

## How to use

Download/Clone this repository and install all required modules by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` or whatever the equivalent in your platform is, this requires git on Python 3.11 due to the latest `wordcloud` package not supporting 3.11.

Edit the `parameters.toml` according to the accompanying comments and save the file.

Run `python main.py` and you should see your new wordcloud in the `image` folder.
